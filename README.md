#### Martingale Strategy Simulation


This project is a simulation designed to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the Martingale strategy ( or any other strategy) in gambling. The Martingale strategy is a popular betting system that suggests doubling your bet after every loss to recover previous losses and gain a profit. However, this simulation shows that the strategy (and every other) is flawed and ultimately leads to financial ruin.

The purpose of this app is educational: to highlight the risks of gambling and the dangers of relying on strategies like Martingale.

#### Introduction

The Martingale strategy is often misunderstood as a "surefire" way to win in gambling. This simulation demonstrates that:
- Gambling is inherently risky.
- The Martingale strategy does not prevent losses.
- Over time, the strategy leads to significant financial loss.

This app is not a gambling platform and does not promote gambling. It is purely for educational purposes to show why gambling strategies like Martingale are flawed.

#### How It Works

The simulation works as follows:
1. The user starts with a predefined amount (e.g., $1000).
2. The user places bets on a simple game (e.g., a coin flip).
3. If the user wins, they gain the bet amount.
4. If the user loses, they double their bet for the next round.
5. The simulation continues until the user either reaches a predefined profit goal or goes broke.

The app tracks and visualizes the user's balance over time, showing how the Martingale strategy fails in the long run.

#### Features

- Interactive Simulation: Users can adjust parameters like starting balance, bet size, and profit goal.
- Visualization: Graphs and charts show the user's balance over time.
- Educational Focus: The app includes a disclaimer and explanations about the risks of gambling.
- Customizable: Users can simulate different scenarios to see how the Martingale strategy performs.
